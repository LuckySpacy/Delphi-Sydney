# Speech Recognition Demo

This demo allows you to record your speech and convert it into text

### Supported Delphi versions

The demo should compile and work for at least versions 10.3.3, 10.4.x and 11

When moving between Delphi versions, for Android please make sure you right-click the Libraries node under Target Platforms > Android (32 or 64-bit) and click "Revert System files to default"

### Supported Platforms

Supported platforms are iOS and Android

### Compiling for iOS

You will need to add the Speech framework to the iOS SDK. There are some instructions on [how to add a framework here](https://delphiworlds.com/2013/10/adding-other-ios-frameworks-to-the-sdk-manager) (needs updating, however it should still work)
