## Apple Signin Demo

In order to use this feature, you will need to:

1. Create an app id in Apple Developer (https://developer.apple.com/account/) and enable Signin With Apple, or use an app id that has this enabled
2. Create or use a Provisioning Profile that uses an app id where Signin With Apple is enabled

You will also need to add the AuthenticationServices framework to the iOS SDK. Please refer to:

When testing, if you need to revoke Apple Signin for the app, follow these steps:

1. On the device, go to Settings
2. At the very top, tap the Apple ID, iCloud, iTunes & App Store item
3. Tap: Password & Security
4. Tap: Apple ID Logins
5. Tap: the application you are testing
6. Tap: Stop using Apple ID
